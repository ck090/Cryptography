This is a complete Implementation of Command Center

A place where one can send any message through an Encrypted Format which uses any of the following three Algorithm.

1. AES
2. DES
3. RSA 

WE can send the encrypted messages with any of those algortihms through Ethernet. 

More about these algorithms on: 

There is an option to save the entire ciphered data to text for further validation, also included is UDP Socket Programming to help with EtherChannel Communication.
